## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Flutter is an open-source framework developed by Google for creating native apps on multiple platforms. It was used to develop the cross-platform user interface of LessonLog, allowing fast and easy creation of mobile apps for both Android and iOS.
  
- **SQL (phpMyAdmin)**: SQL is the structured query language used to manage the LessonLog database. The database is managed via phpMyAdmin, a web application built in PHP that provides a graphical interface for managing MySQL databases. PhpMyAdmin simplifies the creation, editing, and management of data within LessonLog's database.

- **GitHub**: GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories, enabling code hosting, sharing, and collaboration on software projects. It was used to host the LessonLog repository, facilitating version control and teamwork among project members.

- **Figma**: Figma is a web-based interface design and prototyping tool. It was used to design the user interface of LessonLog, allowing designers to collaborate and create interactive prototypes to test and share the look and feel of the app.
